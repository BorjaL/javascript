# javascript paradigms
We all think that we can develop using javascript. That's right.
But there are some dark corners that we just don't know or don't understand pretty well.
With this examples I want to give some light to those paradigms.

For pass all tests, first install jasmine-node:

```
npm install jasmine-node -g
```

And then execute all tests indicating the tests path:

```
jasmine-node .
```

* Scope. Still when my variables are alive.

### Invocations
* Method invocation
* Function invocation
* Constructor invocation
* Apply invocation

### Scope
* function scope
* Closure
